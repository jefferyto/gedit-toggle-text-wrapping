	migration to gedit 3 by Francisco Franchetti. things changed are
	in the .py file

	_ dont use the enums in capital letters; look up the numbers online and use those
	_ gtk -> Gtk
	_ add the do_ in front of activate, deactivate, update_state (not update_ui); a good practice would be to add it to the custom methods too
	_ def statements don't have the window argument (defined for the class in the beginning)
	_ import statements are different
	_ class definition, init are different
	_ delete first line with the !/dev...
	in the .plugin file
	_ [Gedit plugin] -> [Plugin]
	_ IAge=3

	0.2 changed filenames from textwrap to TextWrap as it conflicts with
	/usr/lib/python2.6/textwrap.py when loading the plugin. Unfortunately
	i have no real clue what actualy is causing this conflict. This might
	be reasoned by a change in the Gedit Python Plugin Loader, as this has
	not been happening before upgrading gedit or a prerequisite of it through
	an upgrade of my Ubuntu to 8.10 or 9.04. Added a couple documentst mainly
	to ease the burdon of installation for gedit plugin beginners and made it
	public available on my company website: http://hartmann-it-design.de/gedit
