# This plugin is intended to ease the setting of Text Wrap (aka Line Wrap,
# Word Wrap) by either a Keyboard Shortcurt (currently sticked to Shift-Ctrl-B),
# a new entry in the View Menu or by an Icon in the Toolbar. The use of either 
# option works as a toggle (de- or activate text wrap). The initial setting for 
# new or new opened files is taken from the setting in the Preferences dialog 
# and remembered per file as long thew file is open. 

# This plugin was developed for gedit 2 by Christian Hartmann at <christian.hartmann@berlin.de>. Parts of this plugin are based on the work of Mike Doty <mike@psyguygames.com>
# who wrote the infamous SplitView plugin. The rest is inspired from the Python
# Plugin Howto document and the Python-GTK documentation.
